    ###
    added one feature, with the water cargo of the mother factory

    ###
    removed unnessary features from example kit

       ppo_train_1_1.py
           wrapper/SimpleUnitObservationWrapper_1/SimpleUnitObservationWrapper_1_1

    ###
    removed unnessary features from example kit 
    added ice tiles in immediate 3x3 neighborhood and ice total in the 4 quadrants

           wrapper/SimpleUnitObservationWrapper_1/SimpleUnitObservationWrapper_1_2

    ###
    multiple units in agent, no change to training method (first unit of first factory is being trained)
    use ppo_train model
    ###                
    main_2_0
       agent_2_0.py      with obs_for_units() function instead of SimpleUnitObservationWrapper  

    ###
    multiple units in agent, no change to training method (first unit of first factory is being trained)
    use ppo_train_1 model with extra factory water feature
    ###                
    main_2_1
       agent_2_1.py      with obs_for_units() function instead of SimpleUnitObservationWrapper   


    ###
    multiple units in agent, no change to training method (first unit of first factory is being trained)
    use ppo_train_1_1 model with removed unnecessary feature
    ###                
    main_2_1_1
       agent_2_1_1.py      with obs_for_units() function instead of SimpleUnitObservationWrapper   

    ###
    multiple units in agent, no change to training method (first unit of first factory is being trained)
    use ppo_train_1_2 model with removed unnecessary feature and added 3x3 neighborhood and quadrants
    ###                
    main_2_1_2
       agent_2_1_2.py      with obs_for_units() function instead of SimpleUnitObservationWrapper   


    ###
    each factory spawns first a heavy unit, and then as many light units as resources permits
    ###                
    ppo_train_3_1 model:
        -observations with quadrants and 3x3 surroundings with water only
        -multiple units are controlled during training, but only first unit is used by ppo
    main_3_1
       agent_3_1.py      
        wrapper/controllers_3/SimpleUnitDiscreteController_3  
        
    ###
    each factory spawns first a heavy unit, and then as many light units as resources permits
    observations are richer than version 3_1 with 
        unit type
        cargo details
        units in 3x3 neighborhood
        ore
        rubble and lichen
    ###                
    ppo_train_3_2 model: same as 3_1
    main_3_2: 
       agent_3_2.py      
        wrapper/controllers_3/SimpleUnitDiscreteController_3
