"""
This file is where your agent's logic is kept. Define a bidding policy, factory placement policy, as well as a policy for playing the normal phase of the game

The tutorial will learn an RL agent to play the normal phase and use heuristics for the other two phases.

Note that like the other kits, you can only debug print to standard error e.g. print("message", file=sys.stderr)
